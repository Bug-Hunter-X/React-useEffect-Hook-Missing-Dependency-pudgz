This repository demonstrates a common bug in React applications involving the useEffect hook.  The bug occurs when the dependency array is incorrect, specifically omitting a value that the effect function relies upon. This leads to unexpected behavior, such as infinite loops or stale closures, which can make debugging more difficult. The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly include dependencies to resolve the issue and ensure predictable component behavior.
